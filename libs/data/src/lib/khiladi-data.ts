  description:
    'Khiladi is an Indian media franchise created by Akshay Kumar and Abbasâ€“Mustan, consisting of a Bollywood action film series and an Indian stunt television series starring Akshay Kumar. Other than starring Akshay Kumar and the word "Khiladi" ("daredevil" or literally "Player" in Hindi) in the title, the films and television series have little in common, with the producers, directors and stories being different. The Khiladi film series was notable for its action scenes and stunt sequences performed by Akshay Kumar, including some of Indian cinema\'s most dangerous stunts, drawing comparisons to Hong Kong action cinema\'s Jackie Chan.',
